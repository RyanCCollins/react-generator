# Slush React-generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanCCollins/slush-react-generator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanccollins/slush-react-generator) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-react-generator.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-react-generator)

> React redux generator for automating tedious react component setup, integrated with the [React Redux Simple Starter](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/react-redux-simple-starter) project.

Note: while totally usable, this generator has mostly been replaced by the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate), which takes a feature-first approach and provides out of the box component generators without Gulp.  A slush generator can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slush-generator-scalable-react).

## Getting Started

Install `slush-react-generator` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-react-generator
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-slush-react-generator
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-slush-react-generator && slush react-generator
```

### Generators
The following generators are provided for usage with React
- Stateless Functional Components
```
npm run gen:component
```
- Containers
```
npm run gen:container
```

The generators will create new folders within the component and container directories respectively, along with a accompanying .scss file.  

Coming soon, there will be generators for:
- Action Creators
- Reducers
- Tests

### File Structure
* Some files left out for brevity.  Please reference the files in the [React Redux Simple Starter](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/react-redux-simple-starter) project for information about the file structure.

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
